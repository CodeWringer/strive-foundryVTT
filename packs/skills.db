This seal has to take the form of a pentagram. The medium doesn't matter, although if the seal is destroyed, the soul binding is broken. So, if a mage wants to create a lasting soul-binding, an enduring medium for the seal is advisable.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">A mage can only ever issue commands to a soul that they've bound.
