/**
 * @summary
 * Represents the base type for view models. 
 * 
 * A view model is a "code-behind" file/class, strictly associated with *one* ui template and whose purpose is 
 * to contain *all* of the ui-logic. Ideally, the ui template only ever queries primitive values from the view model. 
 * 
 * View models, much like ui templates, have a hierarchical (parent-child) relationship. Every view model can contain 
 * none or many child view models, while they may have at most one parent. 
 * 
 * @description
 * For example, in order to determine whether an element in the ui template should be visible, instead of having 
 * if-blocks inside the template which check for many conditions, there is a simple if block that only queries 
 * one boolean value from the view model. E. g.: 
 * 
 * {{#if viewModel.isHpVisible}}<span>viewModel.HP</span>{{/if}}
 * 
 * The advantage of this is to keep ui-logic outside of ui templates, where Handlebars would take over executing 
 * its helper functions. Those helper functions are very difficult to debug, as it is difficult to keep track 
 * of where they're actually being called. With a view model, it is immediately apparent which template 
 * is faulty and the code being run can be easily debugged, too. 
 * 
 * Another advantage of the view models is that one can pass in specific instances to be used in operations. 
 * As an example, a button on an actor sheet is supposed to delete a specific item from the actor, when 
 * it is clicked. Without view models, one would have to store the id of the item to delete on the button 
 * (or any other accessible DOM element) and when the button was clicked, it would have to retrieve that id 
 * from the DOM element, then retrieve the item via that id, which implies knowing where the item is stored, 
 * as well. After all, items could be stored on an actor (embedded), in the world or even in companion packs. 
 * 
 * Since, in order to pass in the id of the item, you have to have that id, it can be assumed you also already 
 * have the item or can fetch it. So instead of passing in the id, you pass in the item itself. The view model can 
 * then work with that instance, directly. A layer of indirection and DOM manipulation/analysis can thus be 
 * omitted, entirely. 
 * 
 * Also a feature of the view models is the ability to have persistent view state. 
 * In order to achieve that, view models can write their current state to an object, which can then be 
 * stored in some global location and later retrieved and applied to the view model. 
 * 
 * Since view models are always disposed when their associated document sheet is closed, 
 * their current state, naturally, gets lost. When a view model is re-instantiated, its stored view state 
 * can be fetched from the global location and applied, thus restoring its previous state. 
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Persistent state can only be achieved, if the ids of the child view models 
 * always remain the same. This implies that the parent view model must create its child view models and 
 * pass in explicit ids for them to use. 
 * 
 * @property {String} id Id used for the HTML element's id and name attributes. 
 * @property {ViewModel | undefined} parent Optional. Parent ViewModel instance of this instance. 
 * If undefined, then this ViewModel instance may be seen as a "root" level instance. A root level instance 
 * is expected to be associated with an actor sheet or item sheet or journal entry or chat message and so on.
 * @property {Array<ViewModel>} children An array of the child view models of this view model. 
 * @property {String} TEMPLATE Static. Returns the template this ViewModel is intended for.
